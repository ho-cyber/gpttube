<h3><pad> GPD Takes the Tech World by Storm</s></h3>
<p>Microsoft's announced plans to improve its Bing search engine to include artificial intelligence. GPD, which is owned by Microsoft, has taken the tech world by storm since it's launched two months ago. What's the first words that come to mind when you think of Bing? For most of you, it's probably slow, old, crappy, buggy, inferior, and unappealing.</p>
<h3><pad> Bing Is Associating With Microsoft</s></h3>
<p>associated with the Microsoft, which is associated with Internet Explorer. And we all know how bad Internet Explorer was. In terms of market share, it seems like the whole world agrees. While Bing's market share has been rising within the desktop space, it's still struggling to crack even 3% while Google stands at a towering 93%. So this seems like an open and shut case. Google dominates and Bing sucks, right?</p>
<h3><pad> Bing vs Google - What Is the Difference?</s></h3>
<p>true, but the same cannot be said about profitability and future outlook. Bing is actually substantially more lucrative than Google in terms of per user revenue. In 2022 for example, Bing pulled in the total of $11.59 billion worth of revenue. This means that for every percentage of market share, they pulled in $3.83 billion. Conversely, in 2022, Google search business pulled in a total of $162.5 billion.</p>
<h3><pad> Bing Is Over Twice As Large As Google</s></h3>
<p>After all revenue blows being out of the water, the revenue per percentage of market share comes in at less than half of Bing, at 1.75 billion. In other words, Bing is over twice as lucrative as Google from a per user's standpoint. If Google was as lucrative as Bing, their search revenue itself would jump to $355 billion. So while Bing isn't nearly as large as Google, it does seem like they've been able to carve out an extremely lucrative portion of the market.</p>
<h3><pad> Bing Becomes More and More Profitable</s></h3>
<p>This wasn't always the case. In fact, about 10 years ago, Bing was losing money and overfist. During the worst of it, Microsoft was losing over a billion dollars every single quarter with Bing, and they were down a total of 5.5 billion dollars within just the first two years. But after Southiana Dollar took over, Bing would finally become profitable in late 2015, and since then, it's only gotten more and more lucrative.</p>
<h3><pad> GPT Powered Search Has Had a Far Better Review Than Google</s></h3>
<p>GPT powered search feature has had a far better review than Google. So here's how Bing went from Adject Failure to holding its own against Google. Before Bing could worry about profitability, they first had to build a user base. You would think that the popularity of Microsoft and Windows would make this easy, but this wasn't exactly the case because Microsoft was always fighting an uphill battle with Bing.</p>
<h3><pad> The Ditch Internet Explorer Movement</s></h3>
<p>came out in mid 2009, which was during the peak of the Ditch Internet Explorer movement. In 2008, i.e. had nearly 70% market share, but this would plummet less than 30% by the end of 2013. This meant that Microsoft not only had to convince people to stay on i.e. but also to dig a Google and start using Bing. As you would guess, this didn't really play out all that well, leading to the massive losses in Bing's early history.</p>
<h3><pad> Microsoft Starts Paying Users to Bing</s></h3>
<p>given to Google. So they started looking for new ways to go with their user base, which leads us to their two key strategies, starting with incentives. Microsoft basically decided to pay users to use Bing with their rewards program. If you're not familiar with Bing rewards, it's actually quite appealing. As a new Bing user, you'll be paid five points per search for your first and searches every day. Once you start using Bing regularly and Microsoft can verify that you're not just spamming searches to earn more points,</p>
<h3><pad> Switching to Bing - Earn 250 Points a Day</s></h3>
<p>be upgraded to level 2, which is a lot more lucrative. At level 2, you can earn up to 250 points per day, which translates to 50 incentivized searches. Each point is roughly worth a tenth of a cent, so 50 searches is worth about 25 cents. Clearly, switching to Bing isn't going to make you a millionaire, but it can get you a free chipotle every month, which is a pretty good deal for just going up your daily business with Bing.</p>
<h3><pad> Reddit Community - How to Maximize Your Rewards Points</s></h3>
<p>there is a massive Reddit community with over 100,000 users who focus on just maximizing the value of rewards points. I mean, these people have it down to a science. This user, for example, broke down every rewards point avenue and calculated that you can earn up to $22,50 every month using Microsoft's various offerings. As you can see, Microsoft has been able to create a pretty dedicated community, but bribing isn't their only avenue of growth. Much of Bing's search volume</p>
<h3><pad> Microsoft Partners With Everyone That's Not Google</s></h3>
<p>and the deals. Microsoft has basically partnered with everyone that's not Google. The most notable of these include Yahoo, AOL, Dr. Goa, Likos and Ekoja. And it's not just search providers that Microsoft has been partnering with either. Several years ago, they partnered with Amazon and entered the e-commerce space, and more recently, they partnered with Shopify to bring merchandise listings to Bing. On top of all of this, Microsoft has obviously integrated Bing into all of their</p>
<h3><pad> Bing: Product Offerings That Can Only Be Beat Not by Google</s></h3>
<p>product offerings. For example, if you're searching on Cortana, the Xbox, Microsoft Edge, or the Windows search bar, you're going to be directed to Bing unless you manually change your default search engine. And when you put all of this together, you get a user base that can only be beat not by Google. And now, it was time to monetize. While Bing was able to grow to a pretty sizable user base, one of its biggest shortfalls</p>
<h3><pad> Why Bing Is More Profitable Than Google</s></h3>
<p>choosing Bing due to its search merits. As we discussed, much of Bing's user base comes from Microsoft's existing products and partnerships or bribery. So how could such a platform become more lucrative than Google? Well, the answer is superior demographics. I mean, just think about it. What type of person would switch to Bing it just to earn a couple of dollars every month? Well, it's not the average person because the average person is too concerned with staying socially</p>
<h3><pad> Who's Just A Bingit?</s></h3>
<p>who's just a bingit is the type of person who's obsessed with credit card points, airline points, and hotel points. They probably keep around their broken phone for 8 months just so that they can save 100 bucks on Black Friday. And they're the ones that scam card salesmen, not the other way around. But just because they're so conscious of their spending, it does not mean that they're broke. In fact, they're usually the most well-off, which means that they're extremely valuable at targets.</p>
<h3><pad> Top Searches on Bing Are Related to Travel, Health and Finance</s></h3>
<p>not going to sell these guys on the new iPhone or HBO Max. But an MX Platinum with a 200,000 point signup bonus? Now we're talking. These people are also the most likely to entertain insurance ads, mortgage ads and Fintech product ads. In fact, 30% to 40% of all searches on Bing are related to travel, cars, health and finances. Meanwhile, these are the top searches on Google.</p>
<h3><pad> Bing Searches Are More Reliable</s></h3>
<p>food. While Google searches may be more relatable, Bing searches are far more lucrative when it comes to adsense, because the long-term value of these products are sky high. With mortgages, for example, banks can make hundreds of thousands of dollars with each sale, so naturally they pay a lot more to advertise their products than Walmart or Starbucks. We should also note that Bing's user base tends to be older with the median age of 45,</p>
<h3><pad> Bing - A Win for Bing</s></h3>
<p>a win for Bing. It's not just the financial demographics that are working in Bing's favor either. Bing also tends to benefit from having more desktop users. As we previously touched on, much of Bing's success is attributable to the desktop space where they almost have 10% market share. They're virtually non-existent within the mobile space right now, but this isn't exactly a bad thing because desktop users tend to be far more valuable.</p>
<h3><pad> Bing Will Benefit From Bing</s></h3>
<p>on each site. In 2020 for example, the average mobile user visited 2.67 sites while the average desktop user visited 3.95 sites. Similarly, the average mobile user only spent 160 seconds on each site, while the average desktop user spent 351 seconds on each site. So naturally, Bing is going to benefit</p>
<h3><pad> Bing - The New Microsoft Philosophy</s></h3>
<p>quantitative points as to how Bing is progressing, but the reality is that much of Bing's success actually has to do with qualitative points and especially the new Microsoft philosophy. Before Satya Nadella, the Microsoft philosophy was that Microsoft is the absolute best company and that everyone should use everything from Microsoft, whether that's the Windows phone or MSN Messenger. But Satya brought a much softer perspective to Microsoft.</p>
<h3><pad> The Pro-Chess Has Been More of, How Do We Combine Our Hits With Our Competitors' Hits?</s></h3>
<p>The Pro-Chess has been more of, how do we combine our hits with our competitors' hits to create the absolute best products? As opposed to how do we replicate our competitors' success by ourselves? In other words, Microsoft has shed much of their ego and their much more open to collaboration. For example, they launched Office on iOS. But by far their most humble move of all time was their decision to ditch their in-house</p>
<h3><pad> Chat GPT - What's Next?</s></h3>
<p>wonders for edge, and it appears that Microsoft is bringing the same approach to being as well. The older Microsoft would have probably just pushed out updated versions of Cortana, and that would have been their AI offering. But new Microsoft is embracing chat GPT all the way. Meanwhile, it appears that Google still has Microsoft's older mindset. They want everyone to use</p>
<h3><pad> Google AI, a Google Security System, and a Google Smart Home</s></h3>
<p>a Google AI, a Google security system, and even a Google-based smart home. While this approach has worked for them so well, it's only a matter of time until someone does something better than Google. This already happened in the social media, video conferencing, and self-driving spaces. I mean, Facebook destroyed Google Plus, Zooms and Teams are destroying Hangouts, and Tesla is destroying Waymo.</p>
<h3><pad> Chat GPT - A Direct Replacement to Traditional Search Engines</s></h3>
<p>mean business. However, the same it cannot be said about chat GPT. Chat GPT is a direct replacement to traditional search engines and it's already doing extraordinarily well. Now Google does have their own version of chat GPT called Google Bard which is supposed to come out soon. And who knows, it could be way better than chat GPT. But we should note that initial impressions aren't giving it much credit. I mean, just take a look</p>
<h3><pad> Microsoft Becomes surprisingly Flexible</s></h3>
<p>Microsoft was able to get one million people on a weight list within 48 hours for the new chat GPT-powered Bing. Meanwhile, Google ended up losing $100 billion worth of market cap after their bar announcement. Now, again, for all we know, a bar could be a massive success. But this is just the latest example of Google being stuck in their ways, just like most companies. Microsoft, however, has become surprisingly flexible,</p>
<h3><pad> Bing - More Sustainable Over The Longer</s></h3>
<p>more sustainable over the longer. In the end, Bing came out during a time when Microsoft hate was at an absolute peak. People hated IE and they would go on to hate Windows 8, so naturally they didn't want to try anything that came out of Microsoft. Consequently, Microsoft ended up losing billions with Bing within just the first few years.</p>
<h3><pad> Bing: The Real Turnaround for Bing</s></h3>
<p>offering appealing incentives and making key partnerships, which attracted quite a lucrative user base. But the real turnaround for Bing didn't come until Microsoft stopped forcing their products to an intolerable level. For the first time, people actually started to use edge and Bing out of free will. And now, 1 million people are excited for a chat GPT-powered Bing.</p>
<h3><pad> Bing - The New Search Engine</s></h3>
<p>Clearly, Microsoft is turning things around in a ginormous way. And who knows, in a decade, Bing may not only be the more lucrative search engine, but also the larger search engine. Are you guys excited for the new Bing? Comment that down below. Also, drop a like if you would like to see some actual competition in the search space.
