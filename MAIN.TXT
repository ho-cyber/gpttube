<h3><pad> Rockstar S80RR DLC Review</s></h3>
<p>X. Remember the S80RR is no longer available to buy so if you want to buy it this is the only place to do it unless you have GTA Plus. Sick. For your time trials of course RC time trials are daily now but your normal time trial is sawmill and your HSW time trial is Dell Paro Beach and we'll wrap it up there unfortunately an absolutely horrible week to start off this new DLC. I wouldn't really expect Rockstar to give us any good weeks until the player count starts</p>
<h3><pad> GTA Online Updates - What's Next?</s></h3>
<p>That's kind of a cycle with GTA Online. After updates, they give us really bad weeks. Then as the player counts, dies. Down, they make better updates so that people come back. So yeah, might be a little wild, but anyway, I hope you enjoyed. Hope you stay in safe, and I'll see you in the next video. Boys.</p>
